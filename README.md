# Website of K2D sp.z o.o. sp.k. consulting company

The website was developed by Konrad Paluch.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

In current setup, the `build` folder should be dropped into the correct directory on hosting server, replacing the previous `build` folder. Soon after that, the webpage will be accessible on k2d.pl. Additional server configuration has to be done in service provider's dashboard.
